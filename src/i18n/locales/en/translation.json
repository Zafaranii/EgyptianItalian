    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Why do we retread the tire?",
        "answer": "The retreaded tire is safe, highly efficient, and environmentally friendly because retreading gives a new lifespan to the worn-out tire, as the worn tread is replaced with a new tread, which means a new lifespan for the used tire."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where do the torn tires that you find on highways come from?",
        "answer": "The pieces of torn tires found lying on highways come from new tires, not retreaded ones, because the proportion of retreaded tires in the Egyptian market does not exceed 0.005% of new tires. Most torn tires on the sides of highways come from the tires of heavy transport vehicles, due to: 1- Not adjusting the air pressure in the tires 2- Excessive loads on transport vehicles."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the lifespan of a retreaded tire?",
        "answer": "With regular maintenance and monitoring of tire air pressure, the lifespan of the retreaded tire is the same as that of a new tire under the same usage conditions for the vehicle (transport and equipment)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a used tire suitable for retreading?",
        "answer": "For transport vehicle tires, the tread depth must not be less than 2 mm before the tread rubber wears down to the steel belt. After that, the tire is inspected by a company technician to determine its suitability for retreading."
